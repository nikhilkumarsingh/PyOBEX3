Introduction
------------

The Object Exchange (OBEX_) protocol is a widely used protocol for network
communication between Bluetooth and infra-red devices that provides the
foundation for a number of common tasks, such as file transfer and data
synchronization via the use of "profiles".

Although Bluetooth communication is well-supported on the most popular
operating systems, support for OBEX is limited by the restricted amount of
information freely available on the protocol. The specification of the protocol
is published by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA_). Non-members of this
association must pay a fee to obtain a copy of the specification document.

Most applications and libraries that provide connectivity between, for example,
desktop computers and mobile phones use the OpenOBEX_ library to communicate
using the OBEX protocol.

This package provides a simple Python_ implementation of aspects of the OBEX
protocol based on the information available in freely available
`Bluetooth specifications`_ and other openly accessible online resources.
It is not intended to be a complete, accurate, or fully functioning
implementation of the protocol.

This package depends on Bluetooth support in the standard Python ``socket``
module. Users of Linux and Windows XP systems may also find the PyBluez_
package useful; this provides the ``bluetooth`` module described below.


Installation
------------

To install the package alongside other packages and modules in your Python
installation, unpack the contents of the archive. At the command line, enter
the directory containing the ``setup.py`` script and install it by typing the
following::

  python setup.py install

You may need to become the root user or administrator to do this.


Locating the Bluetooth device
-----------------------------

Low level discovery of Bluetooth devices and services is provided by the
``bluetooth`` module, distributed as part of the PyBluez_ package. You need to
use the following calls to determine the address of the device you wish to
connect to.

Discover the devices available by calling::

  devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()

Look up names by calling::

  bluetooth.lookup_name(device_address)

on each device in the devices list.

Find out about the services provided by a device by calling::

  bluetooth.find_service(address=device_address)

On my phone, the file transfer service has the service ID, "E006", so we can
find out the port on the device that we need to connect to when using the
BrowserClient from the PyOBEX.client module::

  services = bluetooth.find_service(uuid="E006", address=device_address)

The list returned contains dictionaries corresponding to each service. The port
used by a service can be obtained from the "port" dictionary entry. Assuming
that the previous line of code returned a list containing a single item, we can
obtain the port using the following code::

  port = services[0]["port"]

This integer value will be required when connecting to the service.


Using the PyOBEX package
------------------------

The PyOBEX package contains the following modules:

``__init__.py``
            Package file for the PyOBEX Python package.
``common.py``
            Classes providing common facilities for other modules.
``client.py``
            Client classes for sending OBEX requests and handling responses.
``headers.py``
            Classes encapsulating OBEX headers.
``requests.py``
            Classes encapsulating OBEX requests.
``responses.py``
            Classes encapsulating OBEX responses.

For most people, the client module is the most useful module because it
provides a reasonably high level API that can be used to interact with a
Bluetooth device.

Using appropriate values for ``device_address`` and ``port`` obtained using the
``bluetooth`` module, or alternative tools on your system, the following code
can be used to list the files in the root directory on a device::

  from PyOBEX.client import BrowserClient
  client = BrowserClient(device_address, port)
  client.connect()
  client.listdir()
  client.disconnect()

Other methods of the ``BrowserClient`` object can be used to get and put files,
set the current directory and delete files. Use the interactive help facilities
to find out more or read the docstrings in the source code.

Notes on the Sony Ericsson K750i
--------------------------------

In file browsing mode, you may be able to obtain low level information about
the directory structure on the phone by calling the client's get() method with
an empty string.
